### 🚀 AI Research Scientist | NLP & Computer Vision | Fair & Explainable AI

Hello! I'm **Dr. Swati**, an AI Research Scientist specializing in **bias-aware explainable AI**. My work revolves around **bias mitigation, interpretability, and fairness** in machine learning, ensuring that AI systems are ethical, transparent, and socially responsible.
My research spans:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) – inferential commonsense reasoning, cross-lingual transfer learning (especially for under-resourced languages)
- Multimodal AI & Computer Vision – exploring how different data modalities interact to enhance model performance
- Continual Learning – designing AI systems that adapt and retain knowledge over time
I am proficient in **TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras**, and I enjoy building AI solutions that **balance performance with fairness**.

### 🔬 Current Work & Research  
I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **University of the Bundeswehr Munich**, specializing in **bias-aware AI**. I lead a work package within the Horizon Europe-funded MAMMOth project, where we develop multidimensional bias mitigation techniques to embed fairness directly into AI architectures. In this role, I oversee research teams, drive project goals, and coordinate international collaborations, ensuring impactful AI solutions.
