Hello! I'm Dr. Swati, an AI Research Scientist specializing in bias-aware explainable AI. My work focuses on bias mitigation, interpretability, and fairness in machine learning. My research spans Natural Language Processing (NLP), inferential commonsense reasoning, and cross-lingual transfer learning, particularly in under-resourced languages. I have also explored multimodal AI and computer vision, investigating how multiple data modalities interact to enhance model performance. Additionally, I have worked on continual learning, designing models that adapt and retain knowledge over time. Proficient in Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, I am committed to building AI models that are powerful, ethical, and socially responsible.

At present, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich, specializing in bias-aware AI. My commitment to leadership and management is evident in my role leading a work package within the Horizon Europe-funded MAMMOth project, where we develop cutting-edge multidimensional bias mitigation methods to embed fairness directly into AI system architectures. Through this role, I oversee teams, coordinate research efforts, and drive project goals within a large-scale, international initiative, ensuring effective collaboration and impactful research outcomes.

I earned my Doctoral Degree from Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School in Ljubljana, specializing in bias analysis within cross-lingual news reporting, contributing to the Marie Skłodowska-Curie CLEOPATRA ITN project. Prior to that, I completed my M.Tech in Mathematics and Computing from IIT-Patna, where my early research at the AI-ML-NLP Lab focused on Visual Question Answering in the medical domain.
